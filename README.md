# Netflix-EDA-Using-R
 I have done basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix dataset. Through EDA we answer few basic question:
 
* How many movies and series are there?
* What's the mean duration of movies?
* Countries with most movies/shows
* How's the trends of shows released over time?
* Which are the most common genre of the shows or movies?
